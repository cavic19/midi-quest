## TODO:
- Add leaderboards
- Add inversions
- Link with chord DB such as https://github.com/JNKKKK/pianochord.io/blob/master/src/libs/db.ts
- Add complicated chord spanning multiple octaves (add 11, 13 etc., inversion!)
- Add scales
- The keyboard should support at least 2 octaves otherwise it sounds wonky with different chords
